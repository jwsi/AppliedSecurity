# Applied Security Repo

This repository contains two specific topics:

- **RSA:** An implementation of RSA encryption and decryption in C using GNU MP (gmp) to give an insight into how the regular gmp functions may implement RSA under the hood with montgomery multiplication and various other methods.

- **Attacks:** These are attacks on the AES algorithm based on 4 main categories: fault, power, time and oaep. Each attack is accompanied with a compiled attack target (for Linux). The attacks aim to demonstrate the potential weaknesses present in areas of the AES algorithm that can be exploited by an adversary.
