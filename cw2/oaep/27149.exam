Q.1 Consider the parameters N = 3551, e = 5, d = 1373, and c = 888, all
    represented in decimal.  Use them to explain, in your own words, the
    principle of this attack (e.g., how and why it works).
Q.2 To prevent the attack, the vendor suggests altering the software: the
    idea is that no matter what error occurs, the same error code will be
    produced.  Explain whether (and why, or why not) this change alone is
    sufficient.
Q.4 This attack is based on the fact that decrypting a ciphertext of the
    form c = (f^e)*c' mod N produces a plaintext of the form f*m' mod N.
    Show why this fact is true.
Q.8 Imagine you are a security consultant, employed by the device vendor.
    The vendor has heard that exponent and message blinding can be used to
    prevent some side-channel attacks on RSA.  Explain whether these
    techniques would prevent this attack, and why.
